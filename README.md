RealTimePolls is a web portal, from where users can create a new poll for whatever they want. They can add poll entities and descriptions, maybe even images, while setting up their poll. The system then gives them a unique poll-id, which they can share with their intended audience. The UI will then update in real time, as and when new votes are casted. This can be used in any scenario where community views are required. The visualizations need to be soothing, and intuitive (even for non-technical users).

The major work involved will be for the following:
1. Web Interface (maybe using **Nodejs** or **~~asp.net core~~**)
2. Real time UI update (can be using **Socket.IO** or **~~SignalR~~**)
3. Generating poll visualizations (something like **D3.js**)
